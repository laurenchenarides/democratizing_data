# Introduction

## About Me {.incremental}

-   **Degree.** Ph.D. in Agricultural Economics, B.A. in Mathematics

-   **Area.** Empirical industrial organization, food policy (food access and food security), and food supply chains

-   **My burning question.** How can policies and market-based mechanisms be leveraged to address barriers to food access?

-   **Research edge.** I like to create organized data systems to answer food policy questions and tell compelling stories.

::: notes
Hello everyone, and welcome to my presentation. My name is Lauren Chenarides, and I am an Assistant Professor of Agricultural and Resource Economics at Colorado State University. My research focuses on using large datasets to answer policy-oriented questions applied to food retail.

## Involvement in the Democratizing Data Movement

-   **Heavy data user.** I observe behaviors of economic agents (firm or consumer) using high dimensional data.

-   **Opportunity.** Improve infrastructure for data search and discovery, tracking data usage statistics.

-   **Big picture.** Break down barriers to accessing to data; increase citizen participation in policy making.

-   **Buzz words:** Data-driven; evidence-informed; [open government](https://data.gov/open-gov/)

::: notes
As part of my work, I rely on collaborations with the USDA. Several years ago, I became involved with Dr. Lane and her team as an early adopter of NORC and then the ADRF data enclaves.

# Contribution to the Special Issue: <br> "Creating Engagements: Bringing the User Into Data Democratization"

## Main Idea

-   Article focuses on learning from models in other fields to enhance **user engagement**, a necessary precondition to building a community of federal data users.

-   Uses a Theory of Change framework to trace the path from strategic interventions to improved user engagement in data democratization tools.

- Discusses strategies such as reward systems, referral programs, social engagement features, user onboarding, and focus groups to boost user engagement and overcome psychological barriers to technology adoption.

::: {.notes}
I was invited to contribute an article to this special issue titled "Creating Engagements: Bringing the User Into Data Democratization". In this article, I focus on learning from models in other fields to enhance user engagement, which I believe is a necessary precondition to building a community of federal data users. I use a Theory of Change framework to trace the path from strategic interventions to improved user engagement in data democratization tools. I discuss strategies such as reward systems, referral programs, social engagement features, user onboarding, and focus groups as ways to boost user engagement and overcome psychological barriers to technology adoption.

::: {.notes}

-   Explain the Theory of Change framework and how it traces the path from strategic interventions to improved user engagement

-   Discuss the stages: Strategies, Targets, and Outcomes

-   Note the importance of addressing moderators like psychological barriers to technology adoption
:::

## Key Strategies to Build User Engagement

-   Reward systems and referral programs to incentivize usage

-   Social engagement features like social media integration and crowdsourcing

-   Effective user onboarding to communicate value

-   Workshops and focus groups to gather feedback

-   Tie these strategies to promoting the search, discovery, and usage of data to capture value and inform evidence-building

## Considerations and Future Agenda

-   Note challenges like identifying the full scope of federal data users

-   Discuss the need for sustainable funding and resources

-   Emphasize the importance of engaging diverse user groups

-   Lay out a future vision of bottom-up collaboration shaping a new data ecosystem

-   Current project: Data Integration in Food and Agriculture (DIFA)

::: notes
My current project is called DIFA:

-   Developing a platform to improve data infrastructure for research discovery

-   Features include data search and discovery, harmonization of data dictionaries and documentation, knknowledge graphs to visualize potential linkages between datasets, and explainable recommendations for researchers, such as suggesting user-specific datasets, identifying referees by dataset expertise and suggesting journals for authors.

DIFA's mission is to enhance the current ecosystem of human capital and technology that promotes complementary and efficient use of data to strengthen current evidence on major food and agricultural policy issues.

## Concluding Remarks

-   Reiterate the potential of data democratization when paired with user engagement

-   Express optimism for building collaborative communities to address societal challenges
