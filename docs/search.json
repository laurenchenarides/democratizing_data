    "text": "About Me\n\nDegree. Ph.D. in Agricultural Economics, B.A. in Mathematics\nArea. Empirical industrial organization, food policy (food access and food security), and food supply chains\nMy burning question. How can policies and market-based mechanisms be leveraged to address barriers to food access?\nResearch edge. I like to create organized data systems to answer food policy questions and tell compelling stories.\n\n\nHello everyone, and welcome to my presentation. My name is Lauren Chenarides, and I am an Assistant Professor of Agricultural and Resource Economics at Colorado State University. My research focuses on using large datasets to answer policy-oriented questions applied to food retail."

Improve infrastructure for data search and discovery, tracking data usage statistics.\nBig picture. Break down barriers to accessing to data; increase citizen participation in policy making.\nBuzz words: Data-driven; evidence-informed; open government\n\n\nAs part of my work, I rely on collaborations with the USDA. Several years ago, I became involved with Dr. Lane and her team as an early adopter of NORC and then the ADRF data enclaves."

In this article, I focus on learning from models in other fields to enhance user engagement, which I believe is a necessary precondition to building a community of federal data users. I use a Theory of Change framework to trace the path from strategic interventions to improved user engagement in data democratization tools."
